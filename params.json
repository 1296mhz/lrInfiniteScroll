{"name":"Lrinfinitescroll","tagline":"directive to register handler when an element is scrolled down near its end","body":"# lrInfiniteScroll\r\n\r\nIt is a module for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) which allow you to attach an event handler to the element when this element\r\nhas been scrolled almost to its bottom. In most of the case it will be used for infinite scrolling.\r\nIt is very light (about 45 lines of code) and optimized to reduce the amount of $digest loop.\r\n\r\n## Attach an event handler\r\n\r\nsimply set as attribute a function accessible within the $scope\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul lr-infinite-scroll=\"myEventHandler\">\r\n    <li ng-repeat=\"item in myCollection\">\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Change the scroll threshold\r\n\r\nBy default the handler will be called when the user is scrolling *down* and only *50* pixels are remaining before reaching the end\r\nof the element. You can overwrite the 50px by setting the attribute *scroll-threshold*\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul lr-infinite-scroll=\"myEventHandler\" scroll-threshold=\"200\">\r\n    <li ng-repeat=\"item in myCollection\">\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n## Change the time threshold\r\n\r\nTo reduce the amount of $digest loop, instead of calling the handler whenever a scroll down event is detected in the end zone. A time is started and if\r\nno other event is detected within 400ms, then the handler is called. You can overwrite the time value by setting the *time-threshold* attribute.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul lr-infinite-scroll=\"myEventHandler\" scroll-threshold=\"200\" time-threshold=\"600\">\r\n    <li ng-repeat=\"item in myCollection\">\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nlrInfinite scroll module is under MIT license:\r\n\r\n> Copyright (C) 2013 Laurent Renard.\r\n>\r\n> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\r\n> obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files\r\n> (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction,\r\n> including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge,\r\n> publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,\r\n> and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\r\n> subject to the following conditions:\r\n>\r\n> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\n> included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n>\r\n> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n> EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\n> MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND\r\n> NONINFRINGEMENT.
